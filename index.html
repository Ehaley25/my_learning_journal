                    <p>
                        After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                        I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews
                        of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                            This was my first time seeing a street driven hellcat on slicks. Ended up catching the with the owner who was an owner a construction company, 
                            he let me know he put close to $20k in modifications alone!

                            My girlfriend and I decided to take a trip up to flagstaff to see the snow,
                            being from Phoenix this was all so new to me; felt like a cultural shock in a way.
