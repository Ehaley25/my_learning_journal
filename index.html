                    <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student </h1>
                    <p>
                        After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                        I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews
                        of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                            This was my first time seeing a street driven hellcat on slicks. Ended up meeting with the owner who was an owner of a construction company, 
                            he let me know he put close to $20k in modifications alone!

                            My girlfriend and I decided to take a trip up to flagstaff to see the snow,
                            being from Phoenix this was all so new to me; felt like a cultural shock in a way.

                            Today I saw a right-hand drive Volkswagen GTI, this was another nice owner I got to meet! He let me know that
                            his dad gave him the GTI when he was 19 and he kept it and restored it the whole time he was in Europe. 
                            Soon he made a move to the states and brought his beautifully restored piece of history.

                            My girlfriend and I took a camping trip up to Payson, Arizona.
                            While we were up there, I remembered that my grandparents took the family on a trip to a cabin, and we happened to be closer than I remembered.
                            A couple of wrong turns later; we end up at the gorgeous cabin that had me in aw like the first time I saw it.                        </p>

                            As I join my grandparents on a Sunday to watch football without disappointment (Cardinals aren't playing),
                            my grandpa shows me one of the coolest photos I've seen. The three most important men in my life; my father, grandpa, and my uncle.
                            These three are my drive to be better every single day.
