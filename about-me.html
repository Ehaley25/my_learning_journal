                    <h1>Hi there! My name is Elijah and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                    <p>
                        After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                        I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews
                        of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects 
                        using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and 
                        most things about my journey with the world.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How I got started</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only 
                        reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was 
                        also helping others learn and stay motivated.

                            My girlfriend and I decided to take a trip up to flagstaff to see the snow,
                            being from Phoenix this was all so new to me; felt like a cultural shock in a way.

                            As I join my grandparents on a sunday to watch football without disappointment (Cardinals aren't playing),
                            my grandpa shows me one of the coolest photos i've seen. The three most important men in my life; my father, grandpa, and my uncle.
                            These three are my drive to be better every single day.
